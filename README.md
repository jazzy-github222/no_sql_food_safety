# Rating the UK's Culinary Scene 🇬🇧🍴

## Introduction 👩‍💻
Heyy, my name is Jazzy and I'm the Creator of this code. I'm a HUGEEEEE foodie, and I hope you are too! 

## Background 🌄
We're going to travel to the royal capital itself, the UK 🇬🇧. 

If there's **3 things** I can't ignore it's:
- Food
- Traveling
- ...and anything else to do with food

I've had the pleasure of being contcted by the **UK Food Standards Agency** & **Eat Safe, Love** magazine to evaluate some amazing places and decide if they PASS/FAIL for their food hygene. Deciding the future of UK's Top Food Talent will rest on NoSQL databases. 

I can't wait anymore! Let's dig in! 🏃‍♀️
